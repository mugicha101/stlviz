Given an array of integers `input`, construct an output array `output` of equal size such that
`output[i]` is the nearest element to the left of `input[i]` that is greater than `input[i]` (or -1 if none exist).

Input:           [  1,  9, 4, 3, 4, 2, 3, 0 ]
Expected Output: [ -1, -1, 9, 4, 9, 4, 4, 3 ]
